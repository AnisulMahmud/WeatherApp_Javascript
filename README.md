# WeatherApp_Javascript

##Weather App
This is a comprehensive weather application built with JavaScript. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data and forecast data for any city in the world.

###Features
####Real-time weather data: The application fetches and displays real-time weather data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
####Weather forecast: The application provides a weather forecast for the upcoming days and hours as well.
####Search functionality: Users can search for any city to view its current weather and forecast data.
####Dynamic background: The background image of the application changes based on the searched city, providing a more immersive experience.
Usage
To use the application, simply type the name of a city in the search bar. The application will display the current weather for that city and a forecast for the upcoming days.

This project is a great example of how to use APIs in JavaScript to fetch and display data in real-time. It demonstrates the use of async/await for asynchronous operations, event listeners for user interaction, and DOM manipulation to update the UI dynamically.
This project is deployed on gitHub, you can check that out as well.
